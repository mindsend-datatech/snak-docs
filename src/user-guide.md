# Kadena Snap User Guide

> **Note:** The Kadena Snap is only available in the MetaMask browser extension. Users must switch to desktop to interact with the Kadena Snap.

This guide walks you through the steps to connect your MetaMask wallet to the Kadena Snap, install it, approve permissions, and perform basic operations like switching networks and sending tokens.

## 1. Connect to Kadena Snap

When visiting a dApp that uses Kadena Snap, youâ€™ll be prompted to connect your MetaMask wallet.

Your Kadena account will be derived from your **MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase**.

---

## 2. Approve the Connection Request

MetaMask will display a connection request, asking you to approve the origin (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

Youâ€™ll now be asked to install the Kadena Snap, which includes requesting permissions:

Click **"Confirm"** to continue.

## 4. Confirm Final Permissions

MetaMask may show a final prompt to **"Proceed with caution"**, requesting permission to manage your Kadena accounts.

Check the box to **Install Kadena** and click **Confirm** to proceed.

Click **OK** to return to the dApp.

## 6. Switch to Kadena Network (Optional)

If the dApp requires you to use the **Kadena Testnet**, youâ€™ll be prompted to approve the network switch.

Click **Approve** to allow switching to the testnet.

## 7. Fund Your Account (Using Faucet)

To perform any transaction, your new account needs $KDA. Use the official faucet:

Once funded, youâ€™ll see a screen like this while a transaction is being processed:

## 8. Sending Tokens

After funding your account, you can send tokens (KDA and other supported assets) to other accounts and, where supported, perform cross-chain transfers using the Snap interface.

![Send Tokens](./images/send-kda.png)

- **From Account**: Your Kadena address
- **Token**: Choose the asset to send (KDA by default)
- **To account**: Recipient address
- **To chain**: Select destination chain (e.g., Chain 1â€“20; only for tokens that support crossâ€‘chain)
- **Amount**: Token amount to send
- **Gas Fee**: Usually prefilled (fees are paid in KDA)

Click **Send** to broadcast your transaction.

## Done!

You're now ready to interact with Kadena natively from MetaMask via the Kadena Snap. ðŸš€
