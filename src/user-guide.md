# Kadena Snap User Guide

> **Note:** The Kadena Snap is only available in the MetaMask browser extension. Users must switch to desktop to interact with the Kadena Snap.

This guide walks you through the steps to connect your MetaMask wallet to the Kadena Snap, install it, approve permissions, and perform basic operations like switching networks and sending $KDA.

## 1. Connect to Kadena Snap

When visiting a dApp that uses Kadena Snap, youâ€™ll be prompted to connect your MetaMask wallet.
