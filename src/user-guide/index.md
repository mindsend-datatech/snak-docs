# snaK User Guide

This guide walks you through the steps to connect your MetaMask wallet to snaK, install it, approve permissions, and perform basic operations like switching networks and sending $KDA.

## What is snaK?

snaK is a custom MetaMask Snap that allows users to interact directly with the Kadena blockchain. It enables you to:

- Manage Kadena accounts securely inside MetaMask
- Perform cross-chain transfers across Kadena's 20 chains
- Sign and send transactions using $KDA
- View account balances and activity
- Use gas stations to simplify fees
- Buy KDA through integrated fiat onramps

snaK is fully isolated, permissions-based, and built using MetaMask’s secure extensibility model.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is intended for:

- **Users** who want to manage $KDA from within MetaMask
- **Developers** building dApps that integrate with snaK
- **Testers** exploring snaK capabilities on testnet

No prior knowledge of Kadena or Snaps is required, though basic familiarity with MetaMask is helpful.

## What you'll need

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- ✅ MetaMask installed in your browser  
- ✅ Access to a Snap-compatible dApp (or localhost test setup)  
- ✅ Some $KDA (use the faucet if testing)  
- ✅ Basic understanding of MetaMask permissions

> 💡 You can install snaK even without a dApp using the [MetaMask Snap Directory](https://snaps.metamask.io).

## What this guide covers

This guide includes:

- Connecting your MetaMask wallet

- Using snaK to send transactions
- Switching to the testnet (optional)
