# Kadena Snap User Guide

This guide walks you through the steps to connect your MetaMask wallet to the Kadena Snap, install it, approve permissions, and perform basic operations like switching networks and sending $KDA.

## What is the Kadena Snap?

The Kadena Snap is a custom MetaMask Snap that allows users to interact directly with the Kadena blockchain. It enables you to:

- Manage Kadena accounts securely inside MetaMask
- Perform cross-chain transfers across Kadena's 20 chains
- Sign and send transactions using $KDA
- View account balances and activity
- Use gas stations to simplify fees
- Buy KDA through integrated fiat onramps

The Snap is fully isolated, permissions-based, and built using MetaMaskâ€™s secure extensibility model.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is intended for:

- **Users** who want to manage $KDA from within MetaMask
- **Developers** building dApps that integrate with the Kadena Snap
