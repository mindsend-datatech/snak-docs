# snaK User Guide

This guide walks you through the steps to connect your MetaMask wallet to the Kadena Snap, install it, approve permissions, and perform basic operations like switching networks and sending $KDA.

## What is snaK?

Kadena Snap is a custom MetaMask Snap that allows users to interact directly with the Kadena blockchain. It enables you to:

- Manage Kadena accounts securely inside MetaMask
- Perform cross-chain transfers across Kadena's 20 chains
- Sign and send transactions using $KDA
- View account balances and activity
- Use gas stations to simplify fees
- Buy KDA through integrated fiat onramps

The Kadena Snap is fully isolated, permissions-based, and built using MetaMask’s secure extensibility model.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is intended for:

- **Users** who want to manage $KDA from within MetaMask
- **Developers** building dApps that integrate with the Kadena Snap

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- ✅ MetaMask installed in your browser  
- ✅ Access to a Snap-compatible dApp (or localhost test setup)

## Security Guidelines

- The same security practices for ETH apply to your KDA:  
  - Never share your recovery phrase  
  - Use a hardware wallet for maximum security  
  - Be cautious of phishing sites
