# Sending Tokens

After funding your account, you can send tokens (KDA and other supported Kadena tokens) to other accounts and, where supported, perform native cross-chain transfers using the snaK interface. If your token isn’t listed by default, first add it via [Add Custom Tokens](./add-token.md).

- **Token**: Choose the asset to send (KDA by default)  
- **To account**: Recipient address  
- **To chain**: Select destination chain (e.g., Chain 1–20; only for tokens that support cross‑chain)  
- **Amount**: Token amount to send  
- **Gas Fee**: Usually prefilled (fees are paid in KDA)

Click **Send** to broadcast your transaction.
