When visiting a dApp that uses snaK, you’ll be prompted to connect your MetaMask wallet.

Your Kadena account will be derived from your **MetaMask Secret Recovery Phrase**.  

🔐 **Security Implications**  
- One seed phrase controls both ETH and KDA assets  
- Compromising the seed compromises both chains  
- Store it as securely as you would for crypto assets  

💡 **Protection Tips**  
- Use a hardware wallet for your MetaMask seed  
- Never enter your phrase on any website  
- Bookmark official dApps to avoid phishing  
- Enable MetaMask's phishing detection
