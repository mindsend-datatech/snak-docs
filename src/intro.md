# Introduction

MetaMask is a popular Ethereum wallet and browser extension that developers can integrate into a variety of third-party applications. MetaMask Snaps is an open-source solution to enhance MetaMaskâ€™s functionalities beyond its native capabilities.

The **Kadena Wallet Snap**, initially developed by the **Kadena Community** and now maintained by **Mindsend Datatech**, enables users to interact directly with the Kadena blockchain without relying on traditional JSON-RPC endpoints, offering Kadena-native functionalities like sending KDA, performing cross-chain transfers, and retrieving account information.

## What is a Snap?

MetaMask Snaps is an open-source framework allowing secure extensions to MetaMask, enhancing Web3 user experiences. It empowers the addition of new API methods, supports various blockchain protocols, and tweaks existing functionalities via the Snaps JSON-RPC API.

Snaps enable users to interact with new blockchains, protocols, and decentralized applications (dApps) beyond what is natively supported by MetaMask. The goal of the MetaMask Snaps system is to create a more open, customizable, and extensible wallet experience for users while fostering innovation and collaboration within the blockchain and decentralized application ecosystem.
