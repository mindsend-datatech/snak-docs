# SDK Quickstart

This guide walks you through setting up a Kadena Snap-compatible dApp using the official SDK tools. You'll use the `create-kadena-app` CLI to scaffold a Next.js project and connect it to the Kadena Snap via the wallet adapter.

---

## What is this SDK for?

The Kadena Snap SDK provides tools to simplify integration of Kadena’s Snap into modern frontend applications using frameworks like Next.js. It includes:

- CLI scaffolding tools (`create-kadena-app`)
- MetaMask Snap-compatible wallet adapters
- Example dApp templates with Snap support

This setup allows developers to build secure, cross-chain Kadena applications that interact directly with MetaMask using the Snap extension.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is for developers who want to:

- Scaffold a working Next.js dApp integrated with Kadena Snap
- Enable MetaMask Snap-based wallet connections
- Build on Kadena using TypeScript and modern tooling
