# SDK Quickstart

This guide walks you through setting up a snaK-compatible dApp using the official SDK tools. You'll use the `create-kadena-app` CLI to scaffold a Next.js project and connect it to snaK via the wallet adapter.

---

## What is this SDK for?

The snaK SDK provides tools to simplify integration of snaK into modern frontend applications using frameworks like Next.js. It includes:

- CLI scaffolding tools (`create-kadena-app`)
- MetaMask Snap-compatible wallet adapters
- Example dApp templates with Snap support

This setup allows developers to build secure, cross-chain Kadena applications that interact directly with MetaMask using the Snap extension.

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is for developers who want to:

- Scaffold a working Next.js dApp integrated with snaK
- Enable MetaMask snaK wallet connections
- Build on Kadena using TypeScript and modern tooling

## What you'll need

Before starting, make sure you have:

- ✅ Node.js and a package manager (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`)
- ✅ MetaMask installed in your browser
- ✅ snaK installed (see [User Guide](../user-guide/index.md))
- ✅ Basic familiarity with TypeScript and React
